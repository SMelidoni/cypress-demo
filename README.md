# Cypress Demo for React TypeScript 🔬

This repository is dedicated to researching and demonstrating the capabilities of Cypress as an automated testing tool for frontend applications built with React and TypeScript.

## 📌 Introduction

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) has rapidly become one of the go-to solutions for end-to-end testing. With its real-browser testing capabilities, Cypress offers developers a robust toolset to ensure their applications are reliable and user-friendly.

This project delves deep into the Cypress ecosystem to understand its strengths, weaknesses, and integration capabilities, especially for frontend applications using React and TypeScript.
